                    Prior to finding my footing in data engineering, I pursued a career as a research psychologist where I focused on quantifying ambient predicates of social concervative shift.
                    I earned my Masters in Psychology with a concentration in Social Neuroscience from New York University in 2020, where I studied with <a href="https://www.jonbfreeman.com" target="_blank">Dr. Jon Freeman</a> in the <a href="https://www.freemanlab.org" target="_blank">Social Cognitive and Neural Sciences Lab</a> as a Graduate Research Assistant.
                    From 2020 to 2022 I served as the Lab Manager and Research Engineer for Stanford University's <a href="https://www.ssnl.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Social Neuroscience Lab</a> under the direction of <a href="https://www.jamil-zaki.com" target="_blank">Dr. Jamil Zaki</a>.
